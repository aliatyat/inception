Issue 1: Docker Daemon Not Running
Error: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

Solution:
bash
# Start the Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker

# Enable Docker to start on boot (optional but recommended)
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Check if Docker is running
sudo systemctl status docker

# Verify Docker is working
docker ps

Issue 1: Docker Daemon Not Running
Error: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

Solution:
bash
# Start the Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker

# Enable Docker to start on boot (optional but recommended)
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Check if Docker is running
sudo systemctl status docker

# Verify Docker is working
docker ps

Issue 2: Error code 403 

check the connection 

bash$ curl -k -I https://yourlogin.42.fr/

If you see somthing like:

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden 
Server: nginx/1.18.0 
Date: Tue, 09 Sep 2025 15:01:42 GMT 
Content-Type: text/html 
Content-Length: 153 
Connection: keep-alive

403 error means WordPress isn't ready yet. So check the logs to see what's happening:

bash$ docker-compose logs wordpress | tail -10

If the database connection is still failing. Check if MariaDB created the database and user properly:

bash$ docker-compose exec mariadb mysql -uroot -password -e "SHOW DATABASES; SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user WHERE User='wpuser';"


If the database and user weren't created! The MariaDB initialization script didn't run properly. Create them manually now and then improve the script for future rebuilds:

bash$ docker-compose exec mariadb mysql -uroot -password -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS wordpress; CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'wpuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'wppassword'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wpuser'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; SHOW DATABASES;"


Restart WordPress to retry the connection:


bash$ docker-compose restart wordpress

bash$ sleep 10

Now check

bash$ curl -k -I https://yourlogin.42.fr/

If you see somthing like:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Server: nginx/1.18.0 
Date: Tue, 09 Sep 2025 15:05:47 GMT 
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 
Connection: keep-alive 
Link: <https://yourlogin.42.fr/index.php?rest_route=/>; 
rel="https://api.w.org/"

Perfect! WordPress is now working with HTTP 200 OK!
